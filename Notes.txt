 some people got long term effects, while others doesn't even feel anything





Virtual vs reality

- the problem is not always about the "virtual" part, but rather because it's closer to "reality",
 we suffer similar symptomns if the scenario atually happens to us


--------------------
"virtual" problems
--------------------

- low latency
- oculomotor conflict, maybe?
- sudden change of focal distance when coming back to reality


possible solutions

- high latency (obviously)
- cooling down after long usage




--------------------
"reality" problems
--------------------

- unanticipated movement
- fast voluntary head movements
- involuntary change of yaw
- change of yaw through other means than head rotation (e.g via controller joystick)


- insecurity inducing scenarios:
	- sudden change of direction
	- speed
	- acceleration/deceleration
	- height



possible solutions

- slow and gentle change of yaw
	- change of head direction before change of movement direction (mimicking natural human walk)

- reducing the level of "reality"
	- reduce FoV
		- always on
		- selective
		- surrounding frame
		- horizontal/vertical
		- on or both eyes

- discrete movement/rotation


- smooth acceleration/deceleration




- reducing insecurity
	- protective shell



--------------------
novel interactivity problems
--------------------

- confusion of direction




possible solutions

- clear direction identifier e.g cockpit or HUD




High
- pemaksaan arah
- ngatur arah pake stick
- frame rate
- quick head movement


Low
- high speed





**Both**

- reduce FoV

 - always on / adaptive / asymetrical adaptive
 - surrounding frame / horizontal / vertical

- Putting a player into a “cabin”/”capsule”
- Faded sphere



- cooling down after long usage
	- fade to sky blue

**On Rail**

- Discrete rotation

- Visual cue
- Visualizing the movement’s trajectory

- change of head direction before change of movement direction (mimicking natural human walk)


**Controlled**

- Lock direction to view
- VR Step
- Drag direction by view
- Delay direction from controller

Direction via control + view
- body direction visualized through shoulders
- on controller
	- set body as anchor

- on head yaw rotation outside of limit,
	- set head as anchor

- on update
	- on body as anchor
		- view follows with delay

	- on head as anchor
		- body follows with delay


**Scenario**

- R3 - rotates 	- rotation look ahead
